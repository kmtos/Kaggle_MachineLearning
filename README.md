This is a directory of Algorithms used for Kaggle competitions. I used this to jump into the sea of machine learning. 
Everything is written for python3, and I have separated things into 3 categores: ClassifiersAndRegressions, Tools, and Datasets.

In Algorithms, I have my collections of implementations of sklearn's various algorithms. I don't blindly apply them, but attempt to understand them
My study of them are documented in README _ < algorithm >.md. For example, README_SVM.md is about Support Vector Machines.

In Tools, I have various useful functions I have created and compiled that are not dataset specific. Many of them apply to changes to pandas dataframes or numpy arrays.

In Datasets, I have my various analyses of Kaggle datasets.
